# Machine-Learning-Models-Full-Lifecycle
 Developing full lifecycle machine learning pipline
 
##  Step 1: Gathering Data
* Identify varoious data sources
* Collect data
* Integrate the data obtained from different sources
 
 ## Step 2:  Data Preparation and Data Wrangling(Feature Engineering)
* Data exploration:  understand the characteristics, format, and quality of data (find Correlations, general trends, and outliers).
 
 ## Step 3: Data Analysis (Feature Selection)
 
 ## Step 4: Train Model and Test Model
 
 ## Step 5: Deployment of Machine Learning Models
 By deploying models, other systems can send data to them and get their predictions, which are in turn populated back into the company systems. Through machine learning model deployment, you and your business can begin to take full advantage of the model you built.
